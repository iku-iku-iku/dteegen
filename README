# dteegen

## quick start

### install dteegen
```shell
curl -o dteegen https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iku-iku-iku/dteegen/master/scripts/all_in_one.sh
chmox +x dteegen
sudo mv dteegen /usr/local/bin
```

### create new project
```shell
dteegen create new_project
```

### build project locally
You can use cmake to build your project locally without bothering with distribution and tee.
```shell
dteegen build new_project
./new_project/build/insecure/client
```

### deploy project
```shell
dteegen deploy new_project
# then you can see your target(e.g. client, server, enclave.signed.so) in path like new_project.generated/build
```

- You can now send the client and enclave.signed.so to one node and server to another node. 
- Run server in one node with tee support.
- Run client in another node with no tee support.
